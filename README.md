# Signed URL Program
Signed URL generator with,
1) Key Rotation and Versioning - The KEY_VERSIONS dictionary stores secret keys associated with different versions. The generate_signed_url function includes the key version in the URL and uses the corresponding secret key to sign it. The verify_signature function checks the signature using the correct secret key based on the version.
2) IP Whitelisting - The ALLOWED_IPS set contains the IP addresses that are permitted to access the resource. The resource route checks the clientâ€™s IP address against the allowed list and rejects requests from unauthorized IPs.
